# Results

After training, I obtained some results for Near-Earth Objects (NEOs) which show the regions with a high possibility of observing different types of NEOs such as Amors, Apollos, Atiras, and Atens. The results are visualized using contour heat plots and data spread in Aitoff projection. This documentation covers all information, but I want to include details about unexpected behavior and unusual lines cropping up in the heatmap plots that should not be considered. The smooth color distribution is what we have.

## Example Plots

Here are some example plots showing the distribution and high-probability regions for observing different types of NEOs:

   ![Amors Plot](amrosdot.png)

   *Figure 1: This plot visualizes the observable region of Amros NEOs distribution in sky concentrated after considering solar elongation of 35 degrees.*

   ![Apollo Heat Plot](apolloheat.png)

   *Figure 2: This plot visualizes the observable region of Apollo NEOs probabilistic distribution of NEOs per sq. degree in sky concentrated after considering solar elongation of 35 degrees. (P.S. Unexpected behavior and unusual lines cropping up in the heatmap plots that should not be considered).*


   ![Atens Plot](atensl25heat.png)

   *Figure 3: This plot visualizes the observable region of Atens NEOs probabilistic distribution of NEOs per sq. degree in sky concentrated after considering solar elongation of 35 degrees. (P.S. Unexpected behavior and unusual lines cropping up in the heatmap plots that should not be considered).*

   *Figure 4: This plot visualizes the observable region of Atiras NEOs distribution in sky concentrated after considering solar elongation of 35 degrees.*

These plots help in understanding the spatial distribution and observation probabilities of various NEO types if the observation was non-biased based on Granvik et. al 2018.
